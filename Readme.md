# ArticleTemplate
Custom post type for Typecho.

Version V2 is more powerful, but is a paid plugin.

## Usage
Download release and upload to /usr/plugins, be sure folder is `ArticleTemplate`

How to ouput the value of template:
```
<?php $this->template() ?>
```
or
```
<?php $template = $this->template ?>
```
if post type was `standard`, it would output an empty string.

PS:`$this` is a Widget_Archive object
